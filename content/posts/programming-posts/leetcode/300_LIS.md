### Problem Statement

Here we solve [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/). It asks us for the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array. So, for the array `[3, 2, 6, 2, 9, 2, 7, 1, 4, 2, 15, 16, 14, 18, 1]`, the answer would be 6, one of such arrays being `[2, 6, 7, 15, 16, 18]`.



### Solution

We solve this problem by iteratively building a subsequence from left to right, obeying the following rules:

```
Input: Integer Array nums
Initialize subsequence = [nums[0]]

for x in nums:
  if x > last element of subsequence
      append x to subsequence
  else
    find the first element greater than x in subsequence and replace it with x

 return length of subsequence
```

From the above, we can easily infer a space complexity of $O(1)$. Moreover, since we are iterating linearly over a linearly-growing subsequence, we also deduce a time complexity of $O(N^2)$.

The following is an example of the algorithm in work:

#### But why the hell does this work??

In pure, spoken english, the essence of this solution is that when we update the subsequence, we do it incrementally. 

- Case 1: Appending to the end of the array
  - This is easy to understand - if this value is greater than all encountered thus far, obviously it will be the end of the strictly increasing subsequence. Mathematically, this implies that for any pair of indices $n, n+1$ in nums, we have that 
$$
\exists i, j, i<j \text{ such that } subsequence[n] = nums[i] \text{ and } subsequence[n+1] = nums[j] 
$$
- Case 2: Replacing an existing element
  - We replace the smallest element greater than or equal to the new one we add. So, for any value that we replace, in subsequence we are guaranteed that there exists some $nums[i]$ such that $subsequence[m] \leq nums[i] < subsequence[m+1]$

Using these two facts, we can observe that for any length of the `subsequence` array, it is possible to construct an actual subsequence from `nums` of that length. 

So while our updates to the subsequence array may not give an actual subsequence, it reflects the structure of one, preserving the length.


#### Optimizations

We can use a binary search to update the subsequence instead. This will bring the runtime complexity down to $O(Nlog(N))$.

#### Python Code

```python
from bisect import bisect

def longestIncreasingSubsequence(nums: List[int]) -> int:
  subsequence = [nums[0]]
  for num in nums:
    if num > subsequence[-1]:
      subsequence.append(num)
    else:
      pos = bisect_left(subsequence, num)
      subsequence[pos] = num
  return len(subsequence)

```
