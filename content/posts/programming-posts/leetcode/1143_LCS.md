### A Dynamic Programming Problem

To kickstart my blog on , let's look at [this classic question](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/). The question asks, given two strings $s$ and $t$, what is the longest subsequence between them?

For our example, let's use `s="abcdef"` and `b="bcdgf"`. The longest common subsequence should then be `bcdf`. 

I wrote the preceding sentences a while ago and called it a day. Now, I can't even remember what the solution was - while definitely feasible, it seems like magic to me. While writing this article, I will explore the initial approach that I remember using to solve this problem, after which I will go through a few more methods such as memoization to give exhaustive coverage to this phoenix of a problem, always rising up again and irritating me whenever I come back to it.

## Using LaTeX

You can include mathematical expressions using LaTeX. For example, to include an equation:

Inline equation: \( E = mc^2 \)

Displayed equation:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
